This was a project I used to learn a little bit about the USB protocol and reverse-engineering way back in the 2000-2001 time period.

I released it under the "Inebratied Innovation" name (http://inebriated-innovation.org/) because I didn't want to get sued.  Hopefully I still won't.  Since nobody seems to make iFeel mice anymore, I think I'm OK.

The source code I supplied here only runs under BeOS, but it looks like someone did take my research and used it to make a Linux kernel module and support util so some use came out of it: http://tactile.sourceforge.net/

I no longer have a BeOS installation I can test this with, so no guarantees.  It ought to work on BeOS 5 though.
